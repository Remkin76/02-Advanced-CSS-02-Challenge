# Remkin76 02-Advanced-CSS-02-Challenge
This application was developed to meet the criteria below and to showcase my fullstack web development work.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description
The website was developed using the above criteria but did not match the markup. We developed the website in to match certain styling and colour schemes of the main website to the styling and colour schemes of the first work showcase. The first showcase and the image under the header were selected to create a flowing experience for the viewer.

This challenge was extremely difficult and time consuming. Several requests for assitance from the BCS learning assistance proved futile. Basic coding repairs were done to get the website functional using examples around pixel moving. Requests for assitance to use percentage based coding for styling appears to be beyond the understanding of the assiatants.

The header was not able to be fixed due to issues with the anchor position not being able to be a relative reference to the fixed position of the header.

Future developments include, but are not limited to:
    • Fixing the header
    • Referencing the subHeading image so it sits under the header which will alow diffferent flex displays of the header
    • Fixing anchor points so that they are alos referenced to a 'non pixe' reference to the fixed header. Current any anchor points will be displayed under the fixed header.
    • Setting % values for unique positioning of header over images.
    • Working our why the % position for the existing headers sitting over images is not working as it should. i.e. 50% should sit in the middle of the container, but only trial and error of the % works. This also means that the header for the main and other images must be seperated, but shouldnt have to be.
